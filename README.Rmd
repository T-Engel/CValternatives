# CValternatives

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of CValternatives is calculate stuff.

## Example

Let's calculate the PV of a variable Z:

```{r example}
library(CValternatives)
Z = c(2,3,4,5,6)
PV(Z)
```

And now the Consecutive disparity index (D) of the same variable:

```{r}
D(Z)
```
